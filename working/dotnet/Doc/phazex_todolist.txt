FRAMEWORK ISSUES
- Hand count in scores!
- Is possible to run out of cards and crash PhazeX
- Order by Color doesn't work
- Scores::Check turns skipped
- After new hand, fix slow down / speed up hand end -- timer?
- Can freeze the server when connecting
- Game start timer is 1 second, should be 5 / 10.


PXCLIENT ISSUES
- fix so that when always sort by number is enabled, hand context menu sort by color is disabled and vice versa
- When somebody plays a card on a group, make sure that the proper group gets displayed
- When discarding, check to see if our groups work. If so, ask if we want to meld. (this should be an option).
- When discarding, check to see if our groups cards == -1 + hand cards. If so, ask if we want to meld (this should be an option).
- When order by * is checked, getting a card doesn't update hand.
- Don't let ENTER on chat text box result in BEEP
- If we resize the window and the chat is not shown, and we show the chat, it hasn't been resized. You have to resize the window to get it anchored right.
- Show current winner in scores
- If we assign a number to a wild card when we play it on the table, and it doesn't fit, the number does not get unassigned.
- Myturn is incorrect after we meld.
- If we have all cards in melds and discard skip card, it just discards.
- Phaze node expansion doesn't work.
- When game ends, other players who aren't on phaze 10 but finished their phaze are on :: (completed_phaze + 1) + " (done)"
- Should not be able to play skip on colors. This is wrong on a fundamental level. The server should not allow this.
- (known issue?) If we assign a wild, try to play it, it's incorrect, we cannot unassign the wild card (although note that the context menus are not updated).
- GraphicCardPanel doesn't draw correctly when minimized!
- Cards do not get assigned "smartly" when we play on the table
- shouldn't have to assign wild on color set!
- order player list box



PXCC ISSUES
7 Blue Wild
83 Yellow 10
92 Green 11
100 Green 12
Assign Wild card?
- Also, tell type of group when assigning wild card
- Needs to take "ready" as command line param






OLD TO DO LIST (STILL VALID?)
*** implement rules server -- check that it works!
look into case if rules port == conn port

check that when a group is added to the list, that all cards are ordered (correctly)!
	[0]    Run of 7 cards
	Green 7
	Green Wild (6)
	Green 5
	Green 4
	Blue 3
	Red 2
	Red 1
	Blue Wild (8)

make server send turn end when discard! this way if we do something wrong, the client doesn't get out of balance.
server does not disconnect if 3 players connected, 2 drop; also does not exit
server should check when player logs off to check to see if everybody is ready
write deck::shuffleandaddunused
client needs to save idea that other client may be disconnected -- and take this into account when skipped!
server -- when returning card that has been discarded, make sure that we notify that it's their turn still (NOT turn start).
change so that disconnect happens all at once and disconnect message does not appear if game has stopped
